# Tic Tac Toe

This repo is an experiment to try making a model to learn how to play tic tac toe with experience. For this I will try using Reinforcement learning using Deep learning.

## Experiments

I am new to reinforcement learning and have not tackled any dual player games yet. This is my first attempt on taking on a dual player game coming straight from the single player game. Also, this is my very second reinforcement learning problem that I am trying to solve and without any help from internet.

### 1. Training the agent against a random player

The agent did not perform very well while playing against a human. This might be because of the lack of generating all possible actions at all possible states.

### 2. Training the agent against itself

The agent learnt some good tricks but would lose a very odd game.

### 3. Training against the previous generation

The agent again, learnt few tricks but would lose a very simple game. The reason again might be the lack of generation of all possible actions at all possible states.
